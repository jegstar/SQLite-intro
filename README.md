# SQLite-intro

This is our in class introduction to combining SQLite and Python.

I recommend installing the "SQLite Viewer" extension by Floriam Klampfer so that you can see what is happeing with your database. 

As ever there are great resources for practicing SQL online, you can check [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/sql) for a tutorial or [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/default.asp) for a great reference.
